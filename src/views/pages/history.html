As early as the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 25), it had become a festival with great significance. The lanterns symbolize the events of the past year, which are then "let go." They are almost always red, to symbolize good fortune. During the Lantern Festival of 1514, a large fire breaks out, burning down the palaces of Heavenly Purity and Earthly Tranquility.</p>

							Empress Dowager Cixi was a powerful and charismatic woman who unofficially but effectively controlled the Manchu Qing Dynasty for 47 years, from 1861 to her death in 1908.  Selected as an imperial concubine for the Xianfeng Emperor in her adolescence, she gave birth to a son in 1856. With Xianfeng's death in 1861, the young boy became the Tongzhi Emperor and she became Empress Dowager. Cixi ousted a group of regents appointed by the late emperor and assumed regency, which she shared with the Empress Dowager Ci'an. Cixi then consolidated control over the dynasty when, at the death of the Tongzhi Emperor, contrary to the dynastic rules of succession, she installed her nephew as the Guangxu Emperor in 1875. Although she refused to adopt Western models of government, she supported technological and military reforms and the Self-Strengthening Movement. Cixi rejected the Hundred Days' Reforms of 1898 as impractical and detrimental to dynastic power and placed the Guangxu Emperor under house arrest for supporting reformers. After the Boxer Rebellion and the invasion of Allied armies, external and internal pressures led Cixi to effect institutional changes of just the sort she had resisted, and to appoint reform-minded officials. The dynasty collapsed in late 1911, three years after her death, and the Republican Era was inaugurated 1 January 1912.

						<h2>Burning of Yuan Ming Yuan Palace</h2>
						<p>French and British troops occupy the Forbidden City and burn and loot the Yuan Ming Yuan palace outside Beijing. Yuan Ming Yuan (often referred as the Old Summer Palace) was originally called the Imperial Gardens, was a complex of palaces and gardens in Beijing. It is located 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) northwest of the walls of the Imperial City and was built in the 18th and early 19th century as the place where the emperors of the Qing dynasty resided and handled government affairs (the Forbidden City was used for formal ceremonies). Yuan Ming Yuan Palace was known for its extensive collection of garden and building architecture, and other works of art. Nearby, and to the south, was an extensive imperial hunting park known as "Nanyuan".  In 1860 during the Second Opium War, two British envoys, a journalist for The Times and their small escort of British and Indian troops met with the Royal Prince under a flag of truce to negotiate. They were imprisoned and tortured, resulting in twenty deaths. The British High Commissioner to China, Lord Elgin, retaliated by ordering the destruction of the palace, which was then carried out by British and French troops.

Although in theory she had precedence over Empress Dowager Cixi, Empress Dowager Ci'an was in fact a self-effacing person and seldom intervened in politics - unlike Empress Dowager Cixi, who was the actual master of China.

							Emperor Guangxu (14 August 1871 – 14 November 1908) was the eleventh emperor of the Qing Dynasty, and the ninth Qing emperor to rule over China. His reign lasted from 1875 to 1908, but in practice he ruled, under Empress Dowager Cixi's influence, only from 1889 to 1898. He initiated the Hundred Days' Reform, but was abruptly stopped when Cixi launched a coup in 1898, after which he was put under house arrest until his death.

						<h2>Puyi leaves the Forbidden City.</h2>
						<p>
							Empress Dowager Longyu endorsed the "Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor" on 12 February 1912 under a deal brokered by Yuan Shikai (a general of the Beiyang Army), with the imperial court in Beijing and the Republicans in southern China. Signed with the new Republic of China, Puyi was to retain his imperial title and be treated by the government of the Republic with the protocol attached to a foreign monarch.

						<h2>Japanese invasion of China.</h2><p>
							The Second Sino-Japanese War (July 7, 1937 – September 9, 1945), called so after the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95, was a military conflict fought primarily between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan from 1937 to 1941. China fought Japan, with some economic help from Germany , the Soviet Union  and the United States. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the war merged into the greater conflict of World War II as a major front of what is broadly known as the Pacific War. The Second Sino-Japanese War was the largest Asian war in the 20th century. It also made up more than 50% of the casualties in the Pacific War if the 1937–1941 period is taken into account.
