- title: The Future Empress Dowager Cixi  moves into the Forbidden City
  year: 1851
  desc: Empress Dowager Cixi was a powerful and charismatic woman who unofficially
    but effectively controlled the Manchu Qing Dynasty for 47 years, from 1861 to
    her death in 1908.  Selected as an imperial concubine for the Xianfeng Emperor
    in her adolescence, she gave birth to a son in 1856. With Xianfeng's death in
    1861, the young boy became the Tongzhi Emperor and she became Empress Dowager.
    Cixi ousted a group of regents appointed by the late emperor and assumed regency,
    which she shared with the Empress Dowager Ci'an. Cixi then consolidated control
    over the dynasty when, at the death of the Tongzhi Emperor, contrary to the dynastic
    rules of succession, she installed her nephew as the Guangxu Emperor in 1875.
    Although she refused to adopt Western models of government, she supported technological
    and military reforms and the Self-Strengthening Movement. Cixi rejected the Hundred
    Days' Reforms of 1898 as impractical and detrimental to dynastic power and placed
    the Guangxu Emperor under house arrest for supporting reformers. After the Boxer
    Rebellion and the invasion of Allied armies, external and internal pressures led
    Cixi to effect institutional changes of just the sort she had resisted, and to
    appoint reform-minded officials. The dynasty collapsed in late 1911, three years
    after her death, and the Republican Era was inaugurated 1 January 1912.
- title: Burning of Yuan Ming Yuan Palace
  year: 1860

    Summer Palace) was originally called the Imperial Gardens, was a complex of palaces
    and gardens in Beijing. It is located 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) northwest of the walls
    of the Imperial City and was built in the 18th and early 19th century as the place
    where the emperors of the Qing dynasty resided and handled government affairs
    (the Forbidden City was used for formal ceremonies). Yuan Ming Yuan Palace was
    known for its extensive collection of garden and building architecture, and other
    works of art. Nearby, and to the south, was an extensive imperial hunting park
    known as "Nanyuan".  In 1860 during the Second Opium War, two British envoys,
    a journalist for The Times and their small escort of British and Indian troops
    met with the Royal Prince under a flag of truce to negotiate. They were imprisoned
    and tortured, resulting in twenty deaths. The British High Commissioner to China,
    Lord Elgin, retaliated by ordering the destruction of the palace, which was then
    carried out by British and French troops.

    - unlike Empress Dowager Cixi, who was the actual master of China.
- title: Emperor Guangxu's wedding
  year: 1889
  desc: Emperor Guangxu (14 August 1871 – 14 November 1908) was the eleventh emperor
    of the Qing Dynasty, and the ninth Qing emperor to rule over China. His reign
    lasted from 1875 to 1908, but in practice he ruled, under Empress Dowager Cixi's
    influence, only from 1889 to 1898. He initiated the Hundred Days' Reform, but
    was abruptly stopped when Cixi launched a coup in 1898, after which he was put
    under house arrest until his death.

    between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan from 1937 to 1941. China
    fought Japan, with some economic help from Germany , the Soviet Union  and the
    United States. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the war merged
    into the greater conflict of World War II as a major front of what is broadly
    known as the Pacific War. The Second Sino-Japanese War was the largest Asian war
    in the 20th century. It also made up more than 50% of the casualties in the Pacific
    War if the 1937–1941 period is taken into account.
