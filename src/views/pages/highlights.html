				<p class="justify u-margin-bottom-large text-cols--2">
					As China's symbol world-wide like the Great Wall or the Temple of Heaven, the Forbidden City (called "Gu Gong", "故宫"in Chinese, literally meaning "Old Palace") is the most important masterpiece of Chinese history and culture. This real Imperial Palace Museum was for centuries the imperial place for 24 emperors starting from the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Believed as Sons of the Heaven, emperors and their families were the only ones allowed to enter the place as the complex had been created according to ancient Chinese astronomy establishing that emperors should live at the center of Heaven: the "Purple Star" (Polaris). Called the "Purple Forbidden City" in ancient times the site took naturally its name of the "Forbidden City" for ordinary people were not allowed to enter such a divine place. The Forbidden City is the perfect place where some millions of preserved historical relics have been collected, displayed in a site that has kept its original splendid architecture for the pleasure of millions of tourists visiting the old city every year.

				<h2 class="article__title gold-text">History around the Forbidden City</h2>
				<p class="justify text-cols--2 u-margin-bottom-large">
					Together with its awe-inspiring architecture comes the impressive historical richness hiding behind the walls of the Forbidden City. During over 5 centuries, the Imperial Forbidden City has been home to 24 Emperors: 14 during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) and 10 during the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911). This was in 1406 that the construction of the "Emperor's Palace" started under the request of Emperor Yongle (Ming Dynasty). During 14 years, million of workers and thousands of artisans worked hard in the conception of such a building. The stone used in the construction were the one of the nearby Mount Fang (房山Fang Shan) that were carried pieces after pieces to the city. This is even said that some bricks were made from a combination of white lime and glutinous rice!

					As incredible as it can be, these materials ended to be particularly strong for there are still standing today in the capital. Finished in 1420, the Forbidden City started to become the headquarter of China for the capital city of the country moved there from Nanjing. Wartimes, historical events and dynasties' shifts made hard damages to the holly city that was burnt down, rebuilt, sacked and renovated a countless of times. Thus, most of the architecture which can be admired today by tourists traces back to the 1700s onwards. Previously being a site where only emperors were authorized to reside with their imperial family and concubines, the fall of the last emperor of China in 1912 changed the destiny of the city that started to be opened to public and tourists. Recognized by the Chinese central government in 1961 for its important role in China's history, the Forbidden City became progressively a major tourist attraction. The nomination to UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site in 1987 paid a large tribute to this ancient Chinese and human masterpiece that has succeeded in resisting Dynasties, wars, modern times and tourists' continuous visits.

				<p class="justify text-cols--2 u-margin-bottom-large">
					As any ancient city in China or in the world, the Forbidden City is surrounded by a huge city wall: 10-meter-high, 52-meter-wide and representing a total circumference of 3, 430 meters. The 4 city gates located on each side of the city wall have all their function: the Gate of Divine Might (神武门Shen Wu Men, for daily exit and entry of the servants) on the north, the Meridian Gate (午门Wu Men, the main entrance as well as the exact place where emperors announced the new lunar calendar on the winter solstice and other important event. No one else but emperors could walk through it except empresses entering it on the day they married emperors, and the top three examinees of the annual final imperial exams walking out of it for one time) on the south, the Eastern Flowery Gate (东华门Dong Hua Men, ministers entered it to attend the daily morning levee) on the east, and the Western Flowery Gate (西华门Xi Hua Men, coffins of emperors were carted through this gate) on the west. The north and south
					gates are at a distance of 961 meters, while the west and east ones at 753 meters away. On top of that, the four corners of the City are composed of watchtowers which were guarded in the past by imperial soldiers and officers to assure security to His Majesty.

					Different than any other building of China, the Forbidden City is inspiring respect and marvel to its visitors who have the opportunity to feel the impressive historical events that occurred there hundreds of years ago. Some particularities of the City are the typical yellow roofs that symbolizes in China the Royal Family hence its predominance all over the site except for one building that displays a black colored roof. Called Pavilion of Literary Profundity (文渊阁Wen Yuan Ge), the building is in fact the Royal Library: the black color in ancient Chinese symbolism was supposed to represent water, thus extinguishing any possible fire in the building. By visiting the Forbidden City, no one can deny the considerable skills that artisans and workers had already during ancient times in building outstanding and large-scale places. Indeed, as grandiose as it stands, the Forbidden City is today listed as one of the five most important palaces in the world (together with the Palace of Versailles of France, Buckingham Palace of UK, the White House of USA and the Kremlin of Russia).

				</p>

	</span><span>- The Hall of Central Harmony (中和殿Zhong He Dian)<br>
	</span><span>- The Hall of Preserving Harmony (保和殿Bao Be Dian)</span>

					<span>Out of the 3 buildings, the Hall of Supreme Harmony is the most important and largest one where stands what visitors are most enthusiast into seeing:&nbsp; the Emperor Dragon Throne (龙椅Long Yi). The Hall of Central Harmony located behind is the usual resting and rehearsing place of emperors prior to presiding over grand events. Events were indeed usually held in that hall. Finally, the Hall of the Preserving Harmony was the building used for holding banquets and imperial examinations. Standing straight out of that building, the Gate of Heavenly Peace (乾清门Qian Qing Men) is welcoming visitors as it is the main gateway to the Inner Court of the Forbidden City.</span>
				</p>
				<h3>The Inner Court</h3>
				<p class="justify text-cols--2 u-margin-bottom">

				</p>
